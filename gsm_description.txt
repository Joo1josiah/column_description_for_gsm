Example Sample record Â»
A DataSet represents a curated collection of biologically
and statistically comparable GEO Samples and forms the basis of GEO's
suite of data display and analysis tools.
Samples within a DataSet refer to the same Platform, that is, they share a
common set of array elements. Value measurements for each Sample within
a DataSet are assumed to be calculated in an equivalent manner, that is,
considerations such as background processing and normalization are
consistent across the DataSet. Information reflecting experimental
factors is provided through DataSet subsets.
A Profile consists of the expression measurements for an individual gene across all Samples in a DataSet.
Profiles can be searched using theGEO Profilesinterface.

  "ID_REF": "Unique identifier for the gene, typically corresponding to a probe set on the microarray platform (GPL8300).",
  "VALUE": "The measured expression value of the gene in the sample.  This represents the intensity of the signal detected by the probe set, reflecting the abundance of the corresponding mRNA transcript.",
  "ABS_CALL": "Absolute call, indicating the detection status of the gene in the sample. 'A' signifies the gene was detected as present (above background noise).",
  "DETECTION P-VALUE": "P-value associated with the detection call.  A lower p-value indicates higher confidence in the detection of the gene's expression."

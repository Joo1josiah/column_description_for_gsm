  "ID_REF": "Unique identifier for the gene, corresponding to a specific probe on the microarray platform (GPL8300).",
  "VALUE": "The measured expression level of the gene.  This value represents the intensity of the signal detected by the probe, reflecting the abundance of the corresponding mRNA transcript in the sample.",
  "ABS_CALL": "A qualitative assessment of the reliability of the expression measurement. 'A' indicates the signal is reliably detected as present (Absent/Present call). 'P' indicates the signal is marginally detected, potentially present, but with lower confidence. 'M' (if present in the full dataset, but not sampled data) indicates the signal is not detected and considered absent.",
  "DETECTION P-VALUE": "The probability that the observed expression signal is due to random noise. Lower p-values indicate higher confidence in the detection of gene expression. This value is used in determining the ABS_CALL."

{
  "ID_REF": "Unique identifier for the gene, corresponding to a probe on the Affymetrix HG-U95Av2 GeneChip.",
  "VALUE": "Gene expression value, representing the measured intensity of the probe.  This likely reflects a normalized measure of mRNA abundance.",
  "ABS_CALL": "Absolute call, indicating the detection status of the gene in the sample. (A=Absent, P=Present, M=Marginal).",
  "DETECTION P-VALUE": "P-value associated with the detection call, representing the statistical significance of the gene's presence in the sample.  Lower p-values suggest greater confidence in the detection call."
